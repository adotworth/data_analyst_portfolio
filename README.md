# Portfolio Projects
[NFL Head Coaching Diversity](https://public.tableau.com/views/NFLCoachingDiversity/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
<br>Description: Synthesis, cleaning, and analysis of over 1,700 lines of NFL Head Coaching data from multiple sources with a comparison between pre- and post-Rooney Rule implementation.
<br>Skills: data scraping, data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization
<br>Technology: SQL, Excel, Tableau
<br>Results: Trends show an increase in BIPOC head coaches hired in the NFL post-2003 with a decrease the past few years. BIPOC head coaches share the same winning percentage as white head coaches. Although some NFL teams have hired BIPOC head coaches, several NFL teams have never had a person of color at the helm. Offensive coordinator positions are more likely to lead to head coaching opportunities, but BIPOC coaches are under-represented in that position across the league.

[Maryland EdMoney Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/MDEdMoneyDashboard/Dashboard1?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
<br>Description: Synthesis, cleaning, and analysis of multiple data points and sources from the MD Department of Education and Cencus Bureau
Skills: data scraping, data cleaning, data analysis, descriptive statistics, data visualization
Technology: SQL, Excel, Tableau
Results: Trends show that, although all districts are increasing their spending towards instruction, Baltimore City and Worcester County spend almost $2,000 more than other districts per student on instruction. Baltimore City, Kent County, and Somerset Counties all spend significantly more per student on administrator salaries, and, although it has lowered its per student expenditures on administration over recent years, Baltmore County has historically spent much more than other districts on administrators.
